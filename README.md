        According to the visualization, education and income are correlated to voter frequency. As such, when income and education increase, voter frequency increases. Conversely, lower levels of income and education yield lower voter frequency. For example, those who make less than 40k are more likely to rarely vote, and those at the highest income level are more likely to always vote than to rarely vote. Lastly, there is a relationship between education and income independent of voter category. The data indicates that it is much less likely for less-than-high school educated persons to earn over 125k as compared to those with some or full college education, but it is also less likely for college graduates to make under 40k as compared to those with a less-than-high school education. However, those with “some college” are equally likely to fall within all income categories.

NOTE: Sporadic voters make up the highest proportion of the data, so they make up a majority of the education and income levels. Thus, “rarely” and “always” voting categories are better indicators of income and education.

         	There is one outlier among the given years- year 2020. As compared to the other election years, 2020 had both a higher turnout rate among voters, as well as a greater amount of absentee voters. The coronavirus pandemic enabled an increased ease in voting by mail, resulting in a much higher absentee ballot rate than in other years. Furthermore, among presidential years 2016 and 2020, the 2020 election year yielded both a higher turnout rate and a significantly higher absentee turnout rate. Additionally, the overall turnout rate for the 2020 election had a significantly higher variation of vote-by-mail turnout than the 2016 election, but, even as the turnout rate was higher in 2020, the variation in turnout is smaller.

      <h4> <center> HTML Reflection </center> </h4>
      
      <p> 
          In order to meet expectations, I first imported a CSS I found on the internet. The CSS is called Simple.css - A CSS framework. This framework has a sans-serif font, and is very minimalistic. What was great about this CSS is that it is very minimalistic, and does not distract the viewer from the visualizations. Further, I was able to take advantage of the *figure* element, which ensures that the visualizations I import do not overflow off the webpage. The challenges I faced were ultimately ensuring that the spacing looked good, and that I used the right sizings for the different titles. I found this to be easily corrected through trial and error.
